# Envzip - Complete Project Plan

## üìã Project Overview
**Envzip** is a secure, real-time environment variable synchronization system that allows developers to manage `.env` files across multiple projects and environments with team collaboration features.

### Key Features
- Real-time `.env` file synchronization
- Multi-project and multi-environment support
- Team collaboration with role-based access
- Version control and rollback capabilities
- CLI tool for local development
- Web dashboard for management
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

### Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Appwrite (Auth, Database, Functions, Realtime, Storage)  
- **CLI:** Node.js with file system watchers  
- **Frontend:** React with real-time subscriptions  
- **Security:** AES-256 encryption, JWT authentication


### üîß Repository Guidelines
- **Branching Strategy:** Use `main` for production-ready code, `dev` for active development, and feature branches for new features.
- **Commits:** Follow conventional commits (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, etc.).
- **Issue Tracking:** Use GitHub Issues or similar for bugs, features, and enhancements.
- **Code Formatting:** Use Prettier/ESLint for consistent code style across CLI and frontend.

### üì¶ Versioning
- Semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`)  
- Automatic changelog generation from commit messages  

### üîê Security
- Sensitive data must be encrypted with AES-256 before storage  
- Use JWT for authentication in CLI and frontend  
- Secrets should never be committed to the repository
